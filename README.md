Fingerprinting Mobile Application with Deep Learning

This work is my Final Thesis Degree of my Bachelor (Telecomunications Systems Engineering)

Nowadays, Traffic Network Classification is having a high impact on various studies such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems or status reports and Quality of Service systems. The success of the results is due to the evolution of Deep Learning in this area of study during the past years.
In this thesis, a 1D-CNN&LSTM model is designed that, through the encrypted flows coming from a smart-phone, can discover from which applications come from and thus showing is possible to attack the privacy of the people.
Based on a study with 73 different apps, 83% accuracy is achieved in the classification of traces, indicating which are the most vulnerable. To complete the study, applications that provide more sensitive information of the user are selected and which have more samples, and an individual examination is carried out.
